Given the current projected annual income from the Plaid analysis, will a 4% withdrawal rate meet or exceed that value at the 10th percentile? Note: This is basically determining if retirement income is equivalent to current incomexpected
    Based on the projected annual income from the Plaid analysis, a 4% withdrawal rate would me the value at the 10th percentile.

How would a 50% increase in the initial investment amount affect the 4% retirement withdrawal? In other words, what happens if the initial investment had been bigger?
    If the initial investment amount had been increased, then the 4% withdrawal amount would leave Harold with more money to withdraw on an annual basis in retirement.
